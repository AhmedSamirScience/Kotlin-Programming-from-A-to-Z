# What is runtime?
Runtime is the period when a program is actively running on your computer. It's when the program is doing its work, like displaying a game screen or processing data.

A runtime is also a piece of code that helps (in other words, implements portions of a programming language's execution model) the program run, providing it with the necessary tools and resources. This code is usually built into the programming language, so you don't need to install it separately.

Additionally, some programming languages include a "runtime library," which is a set of useful code routines are built as a packaged that programs can use while they are running.

In simpler terms, "compile time" is when the program is being prepared to run, and "runtime" is when the program is actually running.

# Runtime Overview

## Definition
Runtime refers to the period when a program is executing, as well as the infrastructure that supports the program's execution. This infrastructure can include various components that enable the program to perform necessary operations and interact with system resources.

## Key Aspects

### 1. Execution Model
Runtime implements parts of a programming language's execution model, which defines how the language's constructs should behave during program execution.

### 2. Interaction with System Resources
It facilitates the interaction between the program and the computing resources it needs, such as memory management, input/output operations, and system calls.

### 3. Integral Part of Programming Language
Runtime environments are often built into the language itself and do not require separate installation. They are essential for the language's operation.

### 4. Runtime Libraries
Some programming languages provide reusable routines packaged as runtime libraries. These libraries can be dynamically linked to programs, enabling code reuse and efficient memory usage.

## Runtime vs. Compile Time

### Compile Time
- Refers to the period when source code is being converted into executable code by a compiler.
- Involves syntax checking, code optimization, and embedding necessary components that will be used during execution.
- Errors detected at this stage are known as compile-time errors.

### Runtime
- Refers to the period when the compiled program is actually running.
- Involves dynamic operations such as memory allocation, input/output processing, and exception handling.
- Errors detected at this stage are known as runtime errors.

Understanding the distinction between runtime and compile time is crucial for debugging, optimizing, and developing efficient software applications.

## How Does Runtime Work?

### 1. Loading the Program
When you start a program, its executable file is loaded into the computer's memory (RAM).

### 2. Runtime Environment
The runtime environment is a layer over the operating system that assists in running the program. It includes tasks such as:
- **Allocating Memory**: Providing the necessary memory for the program to operate.
- **Scheduling**: Managing when different parts of the program should run.

### 3. External Instructions
The runtime environment provides additional instructions that the program needs, such as:
- Code for handling input and output.
- Resource management functions.

This code is usually built into the programming language and works in the background.

### 4. Execution
During runtime, the program and the runtime environment send instructions to the computer's processor. These instructions are converted into machine code that the hardware can understand and execute.

# Runtime Errors

Runtime errors occur when a program encounters an issue during execution that prevents it from running correctly. These errors can arise due to various factors:

## Causes of Runtime Errors

1. **Insufficient System Resources:**
   - Lack of available system resources such as memory can lead to runtime errors. If a program requires more memory than is available, the runtime environment may not be able to allocate resources properly, causing the program to abort with an error message.

2. **Coding Errors:**
   - Bugs in the software, such as logic errors or improper handling of data, can cause runtime errors. These errors typically occur when the program attempts to execute a section of code that results in unexpected behavior or violates language constraints.

3. **Broken Dependencies:**
   - Programs often rely on external libraries, frameworks, or services to function correctly. If there is a break in the connection or if the required dependencies are missing, incompatible, or outdated, runtime errors can occur. This can manifest as the program failing to access necessary resources or encountering errors during interaction with external components.

## Handling Runtime Errors

Understanding runtime errors is crucial for developers as they diagnose and resolve issues in software applications. Proper error handling, testing, and monitoring practices are essential to mitigate the impact of runtime errors on application stability and user experience.

**Please Note:** A runtime environment typically shows notifications that explain why a crash occurred or where in the program an error happened. To fix these issues, programmers often need to debug the software. This can involve manual inspection or using debugging tools to find the source of the runtime error.

**Another Note:** The runtime system allows the source code to interact with the operating system and get the resources it needs to execute. Errors may occur if resources like memory are not available for the program to access.

# Runtime Terminology Differences

In computer science, the term "runtime" encompasses various meanings and contexts. Here are the different ways it is used:

## 1. Runtime Environment

- **Definition:** The runtime environment refers to the code that enables a program to function by providing necessary libraries, services, and execution support.

- **Usage:** It acts as a layer above the operating system, facilitating program execution and management of resources.

## 2. Run Time

- **Definition:** When written as two words, "run time" refers to the duration or time taken by a program to execute.

- **Usage:** It quantifies how long a program executes and is often measured for performance evaluation.

## 3. Runtime Error

- **Definition:** A runtime error occurs during the execution phase of a program due to issues like insufficient resources or coding errors.

- **Usage:** It denotes errors that manifest while the program is running, causing interruptions or unexpected behavior.

## 4. Runtime Library

- **Definition:** A runtime library comprises low-level routines specific to platforms and compilers, used by the compiler to communicate with the runtime environment.

- **Usage:** These libraries facilitate standard functionalities required during program execution, enhancing portability and efficiency.

## 5. Runtime System

- **Definition:** The runtime system, synonymous with the runtime environment, encompasses all components necessary for program execution, akin to a small operating system.

- **Usage:** It includes management of memory, thread execution, and interaction with the underlying hardware.

Understanding these variations of "runtime" is crucial for developers and IT professionals alike, aiding in effective software development, debugging, and system performance optimization.

# Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. 
In another words, JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine and it provides a run time environment for java bytecode to run. Earlier it was only used for Java but nowadays languages such as Kotlin, Scala etc also uses JVM to run it's code. All Kotlin class files has . kt extension and this is equivalent to the .java extension whenever you write code in Java. As JVM only understands bytecode, kotlin compiler converts all .kt files which are human readable code into .class files which are files containing machine instructions. Once .class files is created the next step is to package all the .class files into a jar. After the jar is ready we can run in it Java Runtime Environment.

## What is JVM?

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a critical component that allows computers to execute Java programs and other languages compiled into Java bytecode. It provides a platform-independent environment by abstracting the underlying hardware details, ensuring consistent behavior across different operating systems and architectures.

## Key Features

- **Interpretation and Execution**: JVM interprets and executes Java bytecode, enabling cross-platform compatibility for Java applications.

- **Specification**: JVM is defined by a formal specification that ensures uniform behavior across different JVM implementations. This specification allows Java programs to run without concern for underlying hardware idiosyncrasies.

- **OpenJDK and HotSpot**: The JVM's reference implementation is developed by the OpenJDK project as open-source software. It includes a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler called HotSpot, which optimizes Java bytecode into native machine code for efficient execution.

- **Commercial Implementations**: Oracle provides commercially supported Java releases based on the OpenJDK runtime. These releases offer stability and ongoing support for enterprise deployments.

- **Alternative JVMs**: Eclipse OpenJ9 is another open-source JVM implementation for OpenJDK, offering different features and optimizations compared to HotSpot.

## Usage

To run Java applications:
1. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system.
2. Compile your Java source code into bytecode using `javac`.
3. Execute the bytecode on any system with a compatible JVM using `java`.

## Further Reading

For more detailed information and updates on JVM:
- Visit the [OpenJDK project](https://openjdk.java.net/) for the latest JVM development and releases.
- Explore [Oracle's Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/) for commercially supported Java platforms and tools.

In summary, the JVM plays a crucial role in enabling Java's platform independence, allowing developers to write code once and run it on any system with a compatible JVM implementation.

**Execution environments Concept:**
Execution environments are typically part of another node that models the computing hardware of a system. For example, an execution environment within a server processor might provide the operating system-level services that are required to support a database application installed in that environment.
