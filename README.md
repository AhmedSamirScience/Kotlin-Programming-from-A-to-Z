# Kotlin-Programming-Summary

## What is Kotlin?
1. Kotlin 1.0 was released in February 2016 and was developed by JetBrains company.
2. It was designed to run on the JVM, a runtime environment that enables programs to be executed on any platform (operating system) that supports JVM
3. Programming languages that can now be compiled to run on the JVM include Java, Kotlin, Scala, and Clojure.
4. Several factors have increased interest in using Kotlin:
   - Easy to learn, flexible, and simple. 
   - Its capability to run on any operating system, such as macOS, Windows, and Linux due to running on the JVM runtime enviroment.
   - The extensive availability of libraries, due to its compatibility with Java, which allows it to leverage Java libraries.
   - The availability of a Kotlin version that utilizes the JavaScript runtime provided by Node.js offers another alternative for where and how Kotlin can be used.
   - The ability to run Kotlin natively on the host operating system offers potential performance benefits.
   - It is Free.

### Procedural Programming (Imperative Programming Paradigm)
  Procedural programming breaks down a program into step-by-step instructions for the computer. It uses procedures/functions to organize tasks, and control structures like if statements and loops to manage execution. Examples are C and Pascal. you can see the figure   
  below for more understand.

### Database Processing Approache (Declarative Programming Paradigm)
It enable developers to specify the solution to a problem without detailing the implementation steps. The language or environment then decides how to execute the solution. SQL, used for database queries, is a prominent example of such a declarative language.

### Object Oriented Programming (Imperative Programming Paradigm)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) organizes systems around objects, each containing its own data (state) and behavior. Java and C# are prime examples of this approach.

### Functional Programming (Declarative Programming Paradigm)
Functional Programming languages break down problems into functions. Each function operates solely on its inputs, independent of external state, to produce outputs. Haskell and Clojure exemplify functional programming languages.

Kotlin supports functional programming through features like higher-order functions, immutability, and lambda expressions. This enables developers to write concise and expressive code that focuses on operations on data rather than managing mutable state, making it suitable for functional programming paradigms.

Therefore, kotlin stands out as a hybrid programming language that enables developers to seamlessly integrate procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming approaches.

## Kotlin Libraries

   - RESTful Web Service frameworks such as Ktor.
   - Database access libraries.
   - Concurrency libraries
   - Logging frameworks allowing you to record information during the execution of an application that allows for detailed analysis at a later date.
   - Testing and mocking libraries.
   - Machine Learning and Data Analysis libraries.
   - Mobile application development libraries.
   - Image compression libraries.
   - Games libraries such as KTX

A very useful resource to look at, which introduces many of these libraries (also you will see all of the events) [link](https://www.kotlinresources.com/).
