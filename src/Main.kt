 *
 *
 * In Kotlin, you can create properties that do not have a backing field, meaning the property doesn't store any value.
 * Instead, the getter function directly returns a computed or hardcoded value.
 * This approach can be useful when you want to expose some information as a property, but the value is not actually stored within the class.

class GameObject {

    // Property without a backing field
    val isHome: Boolean
        get() {
            // The getter returns a hardcoded value
            return false
        }
}

/**
 * Explanation:
 *
 * - The `isHome` property in the `GameObject` class does not have a backing field.
 * - The getter for `isHome` simply returns a hardcoded value (`false`).
 * - To client code, `isHome` appears like any other property, but it does not store a value; it always returns `false` when accessed.
 *
 * Use Cases for Properties Without a Backing Field:
 *
 * 1. **Computed Properties**: When the value of a property is computed dynamically and does not need to be stored.
 * 2. **Constant Values**: When you want to expose a constant value as a property.
 * 3. **Read-Only Interface**: When you want to provide a property-like interface without managing any state.

/**
 * Summary:
 * Property Without a Backing Field: The isHome property in the GameObject class is an example of a property that doesn't store any value. Instead, it always returns a hardcoded value (false) via its getter function.
 *
 * No State Management: Since there is no backing field, the property doesn't manage any state. The getter directly provides the value when the property is accessed.
 *
 * Use Cases:
 *
 * Computed Properties: Use this approach when a property's value is computed on-the-fly or is constant, and there's no need to store the value.
 * Constant Values: This is useful for properties that represent constant values that do not change.
 * Read-Only Interface: It provides a way to expose a property-like interface without managing internal state, making the code more expressive.
 * This class.kt file illustrates how to define and use properties without a backing field in Kotlin, demonstrating their practical use cases and advantages in certain scenarios.
