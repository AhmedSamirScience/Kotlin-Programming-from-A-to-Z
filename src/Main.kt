/**
 * This file demonstrates the use of `lateinit` with `var` properties in Kotlin.
 *
 * The `lateinit` modifier allows a `var` property to be initialized later, rather than at the time of declaration or within an `init` block.
 * The developer is responsible for ensuring that the property is initialized before it is accessed; otherwise, a runtime error will occur.

/*
 * If the title property is not initialized before usage, the following runtime error occurs:

/**
 * Explanation:
 *
 * - The `title` property in `MyUtils` is marked with `lateinit`, indicating that it will be initialized later.
 * - The `printTitle` function accesses the `title` property, printing its length and value.
 * - If `title` is not initialized before `printTitle` is called, a `UninitializedPropertyAccessException` will be thrown at runtime.
 *
 * Restrictions on `lateinit`:
 *
 * 1. Can only be used with `var` (readâ€“write) properties.
 * 2. Cannot be used with nullable properties.
 * 3. Cannot be used with basic or fundamental types such as `Int`, `Boolean`, `Double`, etc.
 */

/**
 * Summary:
 *
 * - **`lateinit` Usage**: The `lateinit` keyword allows you to delay the initialization of a `var` property. It provides flexibility in situations where the property cannot be immediately initialized but will be set before use.
 *
 * - **Important Considerations**:
 *   - Ensure that the `lateinit` property is initialized before any access; otherwise, a `UninitializedPropertyAccessException` will occur at runtime.
 *   - `lateinit` is limited to non-nullable reference types and cannot be applied to basic types or nullable properties.
 *
 * - **Example**:
 *   - The `MyUtils` object demonstrates how to declare a `lateinit` property (`title`), set it later, and then access it safely. If the property is accessed without initialization, a runtime error is triggered.
 *
 * Explanation:
 * MyUtils Object: The object contains a lateinit var property title, which is intended to be initialized later in the program.
 * printTitle Function: This function accesses the title property and prints its length and value. It relies on title being initialized before it is called.
 * Runtime Safety: If the title property is not initialized before use, Kotlin throws an UninitializedPropertyAccessException at runtime, alerting the developer to the issue.
 * Restrictions: lateinit can only be used with var properties that are non-nullable reference types, not with basic data types or nullable types.
 * This class.kt file provides a complete and structured example of how to use lateinit with var properties in Kotlin, with detailed comments explaining the correct usage, potential pitfalls, and runtime safety considerations.
